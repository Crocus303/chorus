# Chorus
A nice web ui for xbmc, focused on user experience
Currently only for music and movies, but it might support tv and photos in the future.

Used by the [Doghouse Media Team](http://dhmedia.com.au) to control the shared office music box
(an old pc running XBMC with chorus, plugged into an amp and a nas)

## Requirements
- XBMC v12 or 13
- A modern web browser, this has been developed and tested in Chrome

## Installing
Install webinerface.chorus.zip via the zip, basically:
- XBMC > Settings > AddOns > Install from zip
TODO: Get it in the XBMC repo

## Updating / Manual install
Updating via a zip through the ui is proving patchy for me, so if you are updating from an older version or
have any problems with installing eg. stuck on "loading application" then you should try this:
- Find your user addons folder. eg ~/.xbmc/addons or %user%/AppData/roaming/XBMC/addons
- Delete the addons/webinerface.chorus folder (if exists)
- Grab the latest webinerface.chorus.zip and extract its contents into your addons folder
- You should now have a addons/webinerface.chorus folder again
- Restart xbmc and refresh your browser for good measure

## Enabling
- XBMC > Stystem > Settings > Services > Webserver
- tick allow access via http
- select web interface
- select chorus

## Using
Add your music/movies sources and do a full music/video scan in xbmc.
Then simply go to the address of the computer running xbmc in your browser
(if you are using a port number add that to the url)
eg.
- http://localhost/
- http://localhost:8080/
- http://192.168.0.10/
TIP: Get your IP via XBMC > System > System Info

## Performance
If you have a large library (20000+ songs), some things get a bit sluggish, especially
if either client or server are low power (eg. not a pc).

## Target Device
This is really tailored for a fairly large screen, it downsizes nicely to about 1200px wide.
Mobile it is useless at the moment, but a possibility for the future.


## Stream music from your XBMC library into your browser ##
As of version 0.2.0 you can use chorus to control XBMC or use it to stream the music direct to your browser!
This is still quite experimental and there are a few minor hiccups to consider:
- It doesn't want to work with Firefox, possible an issue with HTML5 audio and mp3s. When using Chrome and even Internet Explorer 10 it works great.
- Seeking works intermittently, I think it might be to do with how much of the song is cached, I have also heard that Gotham might fix this but have not yet tried.
- It didn't work on my Android Media Player, this could also be caused by the XBMC version/build
- I Haven't tested it over the internet yet, but works great over a LAN
Otherwise it works really well!

### How to use this browser streaming ###
In the top right there are some tabs, two of them are named XBMC and Local, this is how you toggle what player the UI
is controlling.  In Local mode the colour scheme becomes lighter with a hint of blue, In XBMC mode the colors are
the default darker scheme with a touch of orange.  When you are in a given mode, actions affect that player, so if you
click Play on a track when in Local mode, it will play through the browser, likewise, when in XBMC mode all commands are
sent to XBMC.  You can also add media to other playlists by clicking the menu buttons (three dots vertical) on most media items.


## Video streaming
Video streaming via HTML5 "sort of" works, it really depends on the codec used. An embedded VLC player is also available with better codec support.
This looks like the best we can get until XBMC supports transcoding. Look for the "stream" tab on a movie.


## Supported xbmc addons
- Soundcloud

## Developers


### Compiling
Sass and Grunt are used to compile css and js in the dist folder

### Contributing
If you would like to make this project better I would appreciate any help. Send me your merge requests!
A few things that are "nice to haves"

- Backbone, this is my first project using backbone and I am sure I could be doing some things better (refactor)
- Addons, Make it work with your favourite addon - I attempted google music but failed even using it via the ui
- Mobile/Tablet App, I would love to reuse a lot of the code as an app, but dont know how
- Video Support, Movies work, now we need tv
- Browser streaming audio playback... maybe you want it to work in firefox?
- Photo library, I wouldn't use it, but you might!
